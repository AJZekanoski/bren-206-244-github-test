```

Type your name (or anything else) HERE: Giraffes give birth standing up so baby giraffes fall like six feet to the ground right when they're born.

Here's some code (change the variable names and values):
```{r}
# Change these variable names and values:

innout <- 9000

mcdonalds <- 4

fiveguys <- innout/mcdonalds

```

After making minimal changes, SAVE this .Rmd (default will be to the project folder, but check to make sure).

Notice that if you click on the 'Git' tab (up by the Environment tab), now your newly created Project (.Rproj) and updated .Rmd are there (along with, probably, a gitignore file that you don't really need to worry about).

Stage, commit, and push your updates back to github (see the step-by-step document).
